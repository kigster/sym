## Summary

What? *Another security gem?* —— Well, funny you should ask! 

You see, security is an incredibly wide topic. The tools around security tend to fall into two classes: swiss army knife wrappers around `OpenSSL`, and more specialized tools. This gem falls in the second category. It wraps a very small part of `OpenSSL` library. 

> __Namely, `secrets-cipher-base64` provides:__
>
> * Symmetric data encryption with: 
>   * the cipher `AES-256-CBC` 
>   * 256-bit private key
>   * which can be optionally password-encrypted.
> * Rich command line interface with some innovative features, such as inline encrypted file editing using your current `$EDITOR`
> * Automatic compression of the data
> * Rich Ruby API and highly extensible approach to encryption/decryption
> * Automatic detection of password-protected keys, 
> * and more...

The main point behind this gem is to allow you to store sensitive application secrets in your source code repo as `AES-256-CBC`-encrypted files or strings (this is the same encryption algorithm that US Government uses internally). The output of the encryption is always a (urlsafe) `base64`-encoded string, without the linebreaks.
 
The private key (encrypted or not) is also a base64-encoded string, typically 45 characters long (unless it's password encrypted, in which case it is considerably longer). 
 
Using a single-line string that `urlsafe_encode64()` generates, makes this gem well suited for encrypting specific fields in the YAML file, or simply the entire file.  This also means that the private key can be easily exported as an environment variable (as it's value is a single-line string).  
 
> NOTE: The library leverages the code shown in the following discussion: http://stuff-things.net/2015/02/12/symmetric-encryption-with-ruby-and-rails/ I'd like to acknowledge the the author of the above thread for providing clear examples of a simple symmetric encryption with `OpenSSL`.

## Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption simply means that we are using the same private key to encrypt and decrypt. The secret can be generated by the tool and is a *base64-encoded* string which is 45 characters long. The *decoded* secret is always 32 characters long (or 256 bytes long).

In addition to the private key, the encryption uses an IV vector. The library completely hides `iv` from the user, generates one random `iv` per encryption, and stores it together with the field itself (*base64-encoded*).

## Installation

If you plan on using the library in your ruby project with Bundler managing its dependencies, just include the following line in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'secrets-cipher-base64'
```
And then run `bundle`.

Or install it into the global namespace with `gem install` command:

    $ gem install secrets-cipher-base64
    $ secrets -h
    $ secrets -E # see examples

## Usage

### Private Keys

This library relies on the existance of the 32-byte private key (aka, *a secret*), that must be stored somewhere safely if your encrypted data is to be persisted, for example it can be saved into the keychain on Mac OSX. 

> In fact, we put together a separate file that discusses strategies for protecting your encryption keys, for example you can read about [how to use Mac OS-X Keychain Access application](https://github.com/kigster/secrets-cipher-base64/blob/master/MANAGING-KEYS.md) and other methods. Additions and discussion are welcome. Please contribute!

You can use one key for all encrypted fields, or many keys – perhaps one per deployment environment, etc. While you can have per-field secrets, it seems like an overkill.

__NOTE: it is considered a bad practice to check in the private key into the version control.__  If you keep your secret out of your repo, you can check-in encrypted secrets file directly into the repo. As long as the private key itself is safe, the data in your encrypted  will be next to impossible to extract. 

### Command Line (CLI)
 
You can generate using the command line, or in a programmatic way. First we'll discuss the command line usage, and in a later section we'll discuss Ruby API provided by the gem. 

#### Generating and Using Private Keys

Once the gem is installed you will be able to run an executable `secrets`. 

    gem install secrets-cipher-base64
    secrets -h   # display help
    secrets -E   # show examples

Now let's generate and copy the new private key to the clipboard. Clipboard copy is activated with the -c flag:

    secrets -gc

Or save a new key into a bash variable

    SECRET=$(secrets -g)

Or save it to a file:

    secrets -go ~/.key

Or create a password-protected key, and save it to a file:

    secrets -gcp -o ~/.secret
    # New Password:     ••••••••••
    # Confirm Password: •••••••••• 

You can subsequently use the private key by either:

  1. passing the `-k [key value]` flag 
  2. passing the `-K [key file]` flag

#### Using KeyChain Access on Mac OS-X

On Mac OS-X there is a third option – using the Keychain Access Manager behind the scenes. Apple released a `security` command line tool, which this library uses to securely store a key/value pair of the key name and the actual private key in your OS-X KeyChain. The advantages of this method are numerous: 

 * The private key won't be lying around your file system unencrypted, so if your Mac is ever stolen, you don't need to worry about the keys running wild.
 * If you sync your keychain with iCloud you will have access to it on other machines

To activate the KeyChain mode on the Mac, use `-x <keyname>` field instead of `-k` or `-K`, and add it to `-g` when generating a key. The `keyname` is what you name this particular key base on where it's going to be used. For example, you may call it `staging`, etc. 

The following command generates the private key and immediately stores it in the KeyChain access under the name provided:

    secrets -g -x staging

Now, whenever you need to encrypt something, in addition to the `-k` and `-K` you can also choose `-x staging`. This will retrieve the key from the KeyChain access, and use it for encryption/decryption.
    
Finally, you can delete a key from KeyChain access by running:
    
    secrets -X staging
    
#### KeyChain Key Management
    
Another tiny executable supplied with this library is called `keychain`

```bash
Usage: keychain item [ add <contents> | find | delete ]
```
You can use this to add an existing key that can be used with the `secrets` later. Of course you can also use the tool to find or delete it.b

3. passing the `-x [keychain access entry name]` flag

####  Encryption and Decryption

This may be a good time to take a look at the full help message for the `secrets` tool:

### CLI Usage Examples

__Generating the Key__:

Generate a new private key into an environment variable:

    export KEY=$(secrets -g)
    echo $KEY
    # => 75ngenJpB6zL47/8Wo7Ne6JN1pnOsqNEcIqblItpfg4=

Generate a new password-protected key, copy to the clipboard & save to a file:

    secrets -gpc -o ~/.key
    New Password     : ••••••••••
    Confirm Password : ••••••••••

Encrypt a plain text string with a key, and save the output to a file:

    secrets -e -s "secret string" -k $KEY -o file.enc
    cat file.enc
    # => Y09MNDUyczU1S0UvelgrLzV0RTYxZz09CkBDMEw4Q0R0TmpnTm9md1QwNUNy%T013PT0K

Decrypt a previously encrypted string:

    secrets -d -s $(cat file.enc) -k $KEY
    # => secret string

Encrypt a file and save it to secrets.enc:

    secrets -e -f app-secrets.yml -o app-secrets.enc -k $KEY
    
Decrypt an encrypted file and print it to STDOUT:

    secrets -df app-secrets.enc -k $KEY

##### Inline Editing

The `secrets` CLI tool supports one interesting mode where you can open an encrypted file in an `$EDITOR`, and edit it's unencrypted version (stored temporarily in a temp file), and upon saving and exiting the gem will automatically diff the new and old content, and if different – will save encrypt it and overwrite the original file.

In this mode several flags are of importance:

    -b (--backup)   – will create a backup of the original file
    -v (--verbose) - will show additional info about file sizes
      
Here is a full command that opens a file specified by `-f | --file`, using the key specified in `-K | --key-file`, in the editor defined by the `$EDITOR` environment variable (or if not set – defaults to `/bin/vi`)". 

NOTE: while much effort has been made to ensure that the gem is bug free, the reality is that no software is bug free. Please make sure to backup your encrypted file before doing it for the first few times to get familiar with the command.
     
To edit an encrypted file in $EDITOR, while asking for a key (`-i | --interactive`), creating a backup file (`-b | --backup`):

    secrets -tibf data.enc
    # => Private Key: ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
    #
    # => Diff:

### Ruby API

To use this library you must include the main `Secrets` module into your library.

Any class including `Secrets` will be decorated with new class methods `#private_key` and `#create_private_key`, as well as instance methods `#encr`, and `#decr`. 

`#create_private_key` will generate a new key each time it's called, while `#private_key` will either assign an existing key (if a value is passed), or generate and save a new key in the class instance variable. Therefore each class including `Secrets` will use it's own key (unless the key is assigned). 

The following example illustrates this point:

```ruby
require 'secrets'

class TestClass
  include Secrets
end
@key = TestClass.create_private_key
@key.eql?(TestClass.private_key)  # => false
# A new key was created and saved in #private_key accessor.

class SomeClass
  include Secrets
  private_key TestClass.private_key
end

@key.eql?(SomeClass.private_key)  # => true (it was assigned)
```

#### Encryption and Decryption

So how would we use this library from another ruby project to encrypt and decrypt values?

After including the `Secrets` module in a ruby class, the class will now have the `#encr` and `#decr` instance methods, as well as `#secret` and `#create_private_key class methods.

Therefore you could write something like this below, protecting a sensitive string using a class-level secret.

```ruby
require 'secrets'
class TestClass
  include Secrets
  private_key ENV['SECRET']
  
  def sensitive_value=(value)
    @sensitive_value = encr(value, self.class.private_key)
  end
  def sensitive_value
    decr(@sensitive_value, self.class.private_key)
  end
end
```

### Configuration

The library offers a typical `Secrets::Configuration` class which can be used to tweak some of the internals of the gem. This is really meant for a very advanced user who knows what she is doing. The following snippet is actually part of the Configuration class itself, but can be overridden by your code that uses and initializes this library. `Configuration` is a singleton, so changes to it will propagate to any subsequent calls to the gem.

```ruby
Secrets::Configuration.configure do |config|
  config.password_cipher = 'AES-128-CBC'  # 
  config.data_cipher = 'AES-256-CBC'
  config.private_key_cipher = config.data_cipher
  config.compression_enabled = true
  config.compression_level = Zlib::BEST_COMPRESSION
end
```

As you can see, it's possible to change the default cipher typem, although not all ciphers will be code-compatible with the current algorithm, and may require additional code changes.

## Managing Keys

There is a separate discussion about ways to securely store private keys in [MANAGING-KEYS.md](https://github.com/kigster/secrets-cipher-base64/blob/master/MANAGING-KEYS.md).

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
